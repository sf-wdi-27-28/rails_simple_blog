# homework submission

**You will submit this file, edited, as your homework**

* As you build your app, keep `homework.md` open.  
* Each time you run a new `rake ...` or `rails ...` command, jot it down in homework.md.  
* Describe what each command does.  If it has arguments, what do they mean?
  * An example is provided below.
* When you're done (even if you don't finish) submit a Pull Request.  Your PR should have just 1 changed file: `homework.md`.


## Rails commands

* `rails new blog -d postgresql` - tells rails to create a new app called 'blog'
  * `-d postgresql` tells rails that it should configure the app to use a Postgres database instead of the default.

* 'rails s' _started the server_
* `rails generate models` - _is what it sounds like lol_







## Rake commands

* 'rake db:create' _made the db_
* 'rake db:migrate' _configured the schema_
* 'rake db:seed' _created original view of data_
* 'rake routes' _viewing newly created routes_
